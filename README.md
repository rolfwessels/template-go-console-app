A short description of what template-go-console-app does.

## 😩 Why template-go-console-app?

- Reason one why this tool exists.
- Reason two.
- Reason three.

## ✨ How it works

A short explanation of how the tool works.

```bash
template-go-console-app --help
```

## ⚡ Install

**Linux / macOS** — installs to `~/.local/bin`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rolfwessels/template-go-console-app/main/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell)** — installs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\template-go-console-app\` and adds it to your user PATH:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rolfwessels/template-go-console-app/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Want a different location? Set `INSTALL_DIR` first:

```bash
INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rolfwessels/template-go-console-app/main/install.sh | sh
```

To upgrade, just re-run the same command. Both scripts pull the binary from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/rolfwessels/template-go-console-app/releases/latest), which is published on every push to `main` under a new version tag.

Prefer to download by hand? Grab the right archive for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/rolfwessels/template-go-console-app/releases), extract, and put the binary somewhere on your PATH.

## 📦 Technology

- Docker for the dev environment
- MakeFile because it just works!

## 🚀 Getting started with development

This project ships with a development container that has all the tooling required to build, test, and publish.

```bash
# bring up dev environment
make build up

# test the project
make test

# run the CLI
make start

# build release binaries for all platforms
make publish
```

To build and push a Docker image:

```bash
make docker-build docker-login docker-push
# or just
make docker-publish
```

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) — for the dev container
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) — for version control
- `make` — available via WSL on Windows, or natively on macOS/Linux

## 📋 Available make commands

## 💻 Development

### Versioning

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR**: Backward-compatible new functionality
- **PATCH**: Backward-compatible bug fixes

`MAJOR` and `MINOR` are set manually via `versionPrefix` in the `Makefile`. `PATCH` is automatically derived from commit count.

```bash
make version
```

### Development Workflow

Feature branches are created off `main` with the prefix `feature/` or `bug/`.
PR builds attach archives as workflow artifacts. Merging to `main` publishes them as a new versioned [GitHub release](https://github.com/rolfwessels/template-go-console-app/releases).

## FAQ

**Can I use this on Windows/macOS/Linux?**  
Yes — binaries are published for all three platforms.

**How do I update to the latest version?**  
Re-run the install command (`install.sh` or `install.ps1`). It overwrites the binary in place from the latest release.
